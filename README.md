# Production Database
Required folder structure for Teedata.  
The default skin in `skins/` is necessary as a fallback avatar.

### Info
Database can be prefilled with assets as needed.   
Assets will be crawled and stored in the database during the seed processes.  
*thumbnails will be generated while seeding the database*

### Structure
To be coherent with Teedata's naming, please consider using only following characters for naming files manually:  
`0-9 a-z A-Z . _ , -`
```bash
├───[category]
├─────[name]
│       [name].png
│       .gitignore -> [name].thumbnail.png
└
```
